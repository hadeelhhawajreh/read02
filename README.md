*As a coder, finding a text editor that works for you is critical. You'll be spending tons of time working in it, so get cozy.*

*For those just getting started and wondering about text editors, why they're important and which to use – keep reading.*

# What is a text editor?
The formal definition is: “A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files.”

Essentially, a text editor is a program on you computer that allows you to create and edit a range of programming language files. AKA this is the place where you write your code!

 + Text editors handle “hand coding” many different languages, i.e.: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and so forth.

 + Word Processors include Microsoft Word, Pages and even Google Docs. And they don't work for coding.


 Features to Look for in a Text Editor
## When it comes to text editors, there are common features that they all share. It's what makes a text editor a text editor. Here are a few:
+ Easy to use and navigate (similar to a good word processor)
+ Find and replace feature (so you can change a single word in the whole file with a few clicks)
+ Cut, Copy, Paste (again, similar to word processors)
+ Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text (also unlike a word processor)
+ Syntax highlighting (unlike your word processor, this makes it easier to read code and pick up any errors)
+ Customizable appearance (such as modifying font size, color schemes, etc., of your editor which optimizes your work zone)
+ Extensibility – (provide some plugin mechanism, or is scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with additional features – this is more advanced)


Text editors are not the same as IDEs (integrated development environment). While almost every IDE has the capability of creating and editing plain text documents, they also include an abundance of other features.

IDEs have different panels and widgets, taking a lot more space. An everyday text editor is much more lightweight and flexible.

(A side note to the side note: the “!=” means “not equal” in Python, Ruby, JavaScript and other programming languages.)

Best Text Editors for Beginners
There are lots of text editors to choose from. However, I'm going to look at what's best for beginners by taking into consideration what is most popular, easy to use and free (or affordable).
